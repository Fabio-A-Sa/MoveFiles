## Here are several documents, namely:

### My Drafts <br/>
Pieces of code for exercises and assessments, notes that I take during practical classes and other experiences using Pyhton language. It is an authentic disorganized notebook.<br/>

### Play - Enjoying the playground <br/>
Varied exercises of easy, medium and difficult level, about the subject taught in the present week. They complement the weekly work developed during the practical classes. Available on [FPRO Play](https://fpro.fe.up.pt/play).<br/>

### RE - Recitation and away weekly Evaluation <br/>
Weekly work developed during the practical classes. There are always five exercises to do. Available on [FPRO Test](https://fpro.fe.up.pt/test). <br/>

### ME - Practice for PEs<br/>
Available on [FPRO Test](https://fpro.fe.up.pt/test). <br/>

### CH - Challenges in Python<br/>
The challenges are extra work for more advanced Python programmers that easily solve the regular exercises. Available on [Moodle](https://moodle.up.pt/course/view.php?id=1738). <br/>
